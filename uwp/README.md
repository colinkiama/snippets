## Install Instructions


(Instructions are from the Vis: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet?view=vs-2019#import-a-code-snippet)


1. You can import a snippet to your Visual Studio installation by using the Code Snippets Manager. Open it by choosing Tools > Code Snippets Manager.

2. Click the Import button.

3. Go to the location where you saved the code snippet in the previous procedure, select it, and click Open.

4. The Import Code Snippet dialog opens, asking you to choose where to add the snippet from the choices in the right pane. One of the choices should be My Code Snippets. Select it and click Finish, then OK.

5. The snippet is copied to one of the following locations, depending on the code language:

%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Code Snippets\Visual Basic\My Code Snippets

6. Test your snippet by opening a C# or Visual Basic project. With a code file open in the editor, choose Snippets > Insert Snippet from the right-click menu, then My Code Snippets. You should see a snippet named Square Root. Double-click it.

The snippet code is inserted in the code file.
